# project2

Design:
* Creating Database goalBotDB with two tables (parent and child)
1. Parent table : userAccount (userName, pwd, avatar)
2. Child table : goalInfo (goal, endDate, ms1, ms2, ms3, ms4, ms5)
(one user_ID can have multiple goal_ID's)
 
Svelte JS:
-Svelte JS is a reactive compiler that works similarly to Angular and Vue, but it is much faster because it prevompiles everything before runtiem.
